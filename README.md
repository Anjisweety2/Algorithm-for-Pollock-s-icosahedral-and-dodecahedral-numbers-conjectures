Based on our modified Pollock's conjectures, 

the functions test whether every positive integer in some given range can be written as a sum of at most:
- 15 icosahedral numbers
- 22 dodecahedral numbers

The expected output is an empty set, which means that there are no positive integers in the given range that CANNOT be written as a sum of 15 icosahedral numbers,
or 22 dodecahedral numbers. The actual output confirms that this statement is true.
